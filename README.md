Viticulture stands as a cornerstone of the global agricultural economy, yet it remains perpetually vulnerable to a wide array of fungal and bacterial diseases that threaten to decimate crop yields and degrade the quality of the final harvest. Traditionally, the identification of these pathologies has relied on the keen eye of experienced viticulturists or manual scouting, a process that is not only labor-intensive and time-consuming but also susceptible to subjective interpretation and fatigue-induced errors. In an era where precision agriculture is paramount, Grape Leaf Disease Detection has emerged as a transformative technological solution, bridging the critical gap between traditional agronomy and advanced artificial intelligence.
